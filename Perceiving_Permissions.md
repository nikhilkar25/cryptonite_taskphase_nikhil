# Changing Flag Ownership

## code

```bash
hacker@permissions~changing-file-ownership:~$ chown hacker /flag
hacker@permissions~changing-file-ownership:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{UrCtEPkP2Ay6GOhcBNGwlDEmMsb.dFTM2QDLzkjN0czW}
```

## learnings

Learnt to change owner of file using chown command.

# Groups and Files

## code

```bash
hacker@permissions~groups-and-files:~$ chgrp hacker /flag
hacker@permissions~groups-and-files:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{YYTPvxGFBAVKE-t4pT7tyswK_0-.dFzNyUDLzkjN0czW}
```

## learnings

```bash
Connected!
hacker@permissions~groups-and-files:~$ chgrp hacker /flag
hacker@permissions~groups-and-files:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{YYTPvxGFBAVKE-t4pT7tyswK_0-.dFzNyUDLzkjN0czW}
```

## learnings

Learnt to change  group ownership of the flag file using chgrp command.

# Fun with group names

## code

```bash
hacker@permissions~fun-with-groups-names:~$ id
uid=1000(hacker) gid=1000(grp12823) groups=1000(grp12823)
hacker@permissions~fun-with-groups-names:~$ chgrp grp12823 /flag
hacker@permissions~fun-with-groups-names:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{YLI8Fk1CBjeINwY2z7hVVNCbFFW.dJzNyUDLzkjN0czW}
```

## learnings

First i used the id command to figure out what group the user is in. Then i change the group ownership to the given group using chgrp comamnd.

# Changing Permissions

## code

```bash
hacker@permissions~changing-permissions:~$ chmod a+r /flag
hacker@permissions~changing-permissions:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{YgXRMbuT6tMGVGYKdzda766DM6_.dNzNyUDLzkjN0czW}
```

## learnings

Learnt how to alter the permissions of the /flag file to make it all readable.

# Executable Files

## code

```bash
hacker@permissions~executable-files:~$ chmod a+x /challenge/run
hacker@permissions~executable-files:~$ /challenge/run
Successful execution! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{UpOxn6EepPNAtV5hlOXUwzprX7z.dJTM2QDLzkjN0czW}
```

## learnings

I changed the permissions of /challenge/run so it can be executed by everyone.

# The SUID Bit

## code

```bash
hacker@permissions~the-suid-bit:~$ chmod u+s /challenge/getroot
hacker@permissions~the-suid-bit:~$ ls -l /challenge/getroot
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 155 Jul 12 10:30 /challenge/getroot
hacker@permissions~the-suid-bit:~$
hacker@permissions~the-suid-bit:~$  /challenge/getroot
SUCCESS! You have set the suid bit on this program, and it is running as root!
Here is your shell...
root@permissions~the-suid-bit:~# cat /flag
pwn.college{cizrqiUdogUvKHlxjkHENM9eQPC.dNTM2QDLzkjN0czW}
```

## learnings

By setting the SUID bit on `/challenge/getroot`, I could run it with root privileges and access the flag myself.
